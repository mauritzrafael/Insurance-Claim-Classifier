The insurance business is a financial services industry that provides various types of insurance coverage to protect individuals and entities from financial loss. 
It is vital for managing risk and providing financial security to individuals and businesses.

Managing large funds involves potential profit or loss. If funds are not available when customers file claims, it results in poor customer service. 
Conversely, if funds are available but no claims are made, the funds are not effectively invested in other assets.

Therefore, I developed a machine learning classifier to predict whether a customer will make a claim based on historical data.

Machine learning model assistance can greatly help an insurance company prepare funds for claims and distinguish fraud claims. 
However, it is important to note that machine learning models can sometimes make mistakes. 
By optimizing the machine learning model, we can achieve better predictions and potentially decrease losses.
